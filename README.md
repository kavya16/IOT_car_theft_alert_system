# IOT_car_theft_alert_system
A vehicle theft tracking system based on Internet of things is designed, which can provide tracking and monitoring function for the owner which is lacking in present anti-theft systems in cars. When the car is stolen, the sensors are triggered and GSM module will send the location information obtained by GPS module to the owner's mobile phone.
